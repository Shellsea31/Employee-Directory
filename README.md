## Description
This week I was tasked to create an employee directory using React. I had to break up the app into components such as Input, Nav, Table and Table Row. I managed component state for the name the user searches for and the data received from an axios request to the Random User API. When the user clicks to view all employees, a table renders with all data from the api. When they click to filter all employees by last name, the employees returned are sorted and the table is rendered accordingly. Finally, when the user searches for the employee by their first name, a single row is rendered inside the table accordingly. If no employee matches the search, the user is alerted. 

## Technologies Used
- React
- Javascript
- Algorithms
- Random User API
